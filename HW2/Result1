The code that I've used with the longest run time comes from our first R class in the graduate program, BZAN 533. For this code, we were tasked to find the probability that a student will get 7 out of 10 questions right who has studied 30/50 questions from the question bank. We randomly select 10 out of 50 questions and count the number of questions that the student has prepared for (1:30). We run a Monte Carlo simulation 1e7 times to find an accurate probability. The total run time is around 30 seconds. The same probability can be found with less runs but for the purpose of this HW I've upped the number of iterations to amplify the significant decrease in time using vectorization techniques.
